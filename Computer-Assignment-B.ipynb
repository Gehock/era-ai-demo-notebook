    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you get to train a game-playing AI from scratch for the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses). This exercise kind of assumes that you are familiar with the game and if youo are not, please read the Wikipedia article [1], consult your friends, or challenge the course assistant to play against you with pen and paper. We consider the simplest version of the game, where only a 3x3 grid is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. The goal of Q-learning is to learn a policy (what to do), which tells an agent what action to take under what circumstances (depending on where the opponent puts their mark). It does not require a model (thus called 'model-free') of the environment, and it can learn purely by self-play once it has been given the rules of the game. The agent will receive a reward of `+1` if it wins and `-1` if it loses a game. \n",
    "\n",
    "This time, no data is loaded and you also need to start by training the model (remember that last time you skipped training). We use a modified implementation following [2], and all code needed for this task is presented below.\n",
